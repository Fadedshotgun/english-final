    <div id="left"><p>Music is an integral source of creativity in adolescents, music creation and consumption lets teenagers explore and display their thoughts and emotions freely. Even though this area continues to be studied, the evidence we currently have suggests that those involved in musical activities perform better in school when compared to those who do not. This makes sense, since it has been proven that Music training helps development in adolescents by improving their mathematical, logical, and spatial intelligence. Also, musical group activities, such as a school orchestra or band, can help teenagers develop valuable skills such as teamwork and strengthen their sense of belonging. These group activities also give shared accomplishments between peers. This isn't just for teenagers though! These musical activities can be enjoyed and benefited from at any age. </p></div>
