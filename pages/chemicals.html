    <div id="left"><p>Music has been shown to have positive effects on your brain chemistry in many ways. Simply singing or even listening to music has been shown to reduce cortisol levels (a hormone that causes stress) and release dopamine. Although more research is needed, scientists have observed that Music engages multiple areas of the brain, including the limbic system, which helps with the processing of emotions and memories. An associate professor at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, Amy Belfi, created a study that compared memories from popular songs and memories from popular celebrity images. She concluded that music was a lot more likely to bring up vivid details when contrasted with the images. Listening to music helps adolescents manage their stress and it bolsters confidence. All data points to music being a net positive effect on the mental health of students, although listening to volumes too high have been shown to be harmful. </p></div>
